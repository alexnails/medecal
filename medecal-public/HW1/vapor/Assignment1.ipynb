    "## First off, Let's recap from Week 1's Lecture and provide some introduction to this assignment. \n",
    "We learned what it means to classify, the basics of the machine learning pipeline, and the importance of a model improving as it learns to the data. In this assignment you will learn about a structure called the De Bruijin Graph and engage in a classification assignment. If you're still a little confused on what classification is, we have provided a Linear Classifier Demo in this assignment called **LinearClassifierDemo.ipynb**.\n",

    "Influenza viruses are enveloped, single-stranded, segmented negative-sense RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza A and B have 8 genome segments encoding major structural and nonstructural proteins, with major antigenic recognition sites within the two spike proteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza replication in the host cell occurs by means of a viral encoded polymerase that lacks proof-reading capability, leading to frequent point mutations. Accumulation of these point mutations within the antigenic recognition sites of HA and NA can result in host immune evasion, thereby causing annual seasonal epidemics. Current estimates suggest that seasonal influenza A and B cause 4-5 million severe infections in humans with approximately 291,000 to 645,000 deaths per year globally. Whilst influenza B remains largely a human pathogen, influenza type A is a zoonotic virus infecting a\n",
    "wide range of avian and other non-human species. To date 18 haemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase types have been recognised, with a reservoir for the majority within birds. These viruses have the\n",
    "capability to reassort leading to the emergence of new strain. Should these include new HA and NA proteins, pandemic viruses can emerge that completely evade the host response leading to global epidemics of often high morbidity and mortality in both non-human and human hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here is some background on past methods.\n",
    "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been used to study the influenza virus genome for over a decade, and is as an important tool in research. Two important data  resources exist to this end; the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource (NIVR), and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), wherein over a hundred thousand influenza genome segment sequences can be found from isolates sequenced across the globe. Bioinformatics pipelines have begun to be developed for efficient processing of this data. Despite the increasing application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to influenza, the pitfalls associated with current mapping approaches have not been explored in depth. Due to diversity of influenza genome sequences, past methods routinely result in a large number of unmapped reads. In turn, this can potentially result in data loss and bias in sequences that are subsequently recovered, analyzed, and submitted to public databases. This has been previously noted in study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Whilst alternatives, such as read classification by mapping to a large database of influenza sequences and subsequent processes can help to resolve this issue, such pipelines are often complex, slow, and require expertise that is not necessarily available in routine surveillance. Secondly, even if bioinformatics pipelines are chosen carefully, sequences of\n",
    "zoonotic (animals) origin may fail to be identified, resulting in a dataset that appears to be low coverage, missing segments, or missing potential future pandemic reassortments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here is the goal of the assignment\n",
    "We aim to show that this problem can be resolved by classification of isolates from reads of genetic data prior to WGS/NGS analysis by directly querying a De Bruijn graph (DBG). To further develop a simple method for querying short influenza genome sequences, we leverage the large number of publicly available influenza segment sequences, creating this VAPOR classifier."

    "As stated in the introduction to the assignment, the main structure behind this classifier utilizes the properties of a De Bruijin Graph. They utilize **kmers**, a set of k long substrings relative to some larger string of genetic data. For example, if the string was 'ATG' and k = 2, you would have 'AT' and 'TG' as kmers. Using kmers, we will build our De Bruijin Graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "These kmers are utilized by the graph to build nodes that are subsets of a set of kmers. Each node will have a corresponding weight which relates to how heavily the DNA subsequence is found, allowing us to update the weights and then classify once weights have been sufficiently trained."

    "Now that the model is finished we must train and test it. Since genetic sequences are unique and De Bruijin relies on mapping, this all looks like it happens behind the scenes since the weights are updated without us ever looking at the weights at indiviudal timesteps. Usually, a large dataset would be split and the model would be saved after training on some unique subset of that dataset and be tested on a different unique subset as validation where we'd be able to see progress over time using a tool (tensorboard or similiar). What makes this specific classifier so amazing is that VAPOR does not require any preprocessing, it is the same as taking a swab of DNA, digitally encoding it, and putting it into a classifier. In comparison, BLAST (basic local alignment seearch tool) requires pre-processing and doesn't deal with mutations nor physical imperfections of isolates that well, so they must be analyzed and \"fixed\" (Using other algorithms to reformat mutated DNA, based of a likeliness of relation to close genetic strings, an application of genetic phylogenesis/homology).
